        question: 'What are the limitations of React?',
        answer: 'React is not a full-blown framework as it is only a library.The components of React are numerous and will take time to fully grasp the benefits of all.It might be difficult for beginner programmers to understand React.Coding might become complex as it will make use of inline templating and JSX.',

        question: ' What is virtual DOM in React?',
        answer: 'React uses Virtual DOM which is like a lightweight copy of the actual DOM(a virtual representation of the DOM). So for every object that exists in the original DOM, there is an object for that in React Virtual DOM. It is the same, but it does not have the power to directly change the layout of the document. Manipulating DOM is slow, but manipulating Virtual DOM is fast as nothing gets drawn on the screen.',
